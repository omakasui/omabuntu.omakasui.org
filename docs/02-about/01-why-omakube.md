# Why Omakube?

Omakube is a spin-off of [Omakub](https://omakub.org), the Ubuntu setup tool created by [DHH](https://dhh.dk) that turns a fresh system into a modern development environment. It takes the same core concepts and goals, but integrates them with the mindset and approach of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org).

Although Omakub has reached a mature and complete stage, I believe there’s still room for growth... and that’s where _Omakube_ comes in. It takes inspiration from the work done with Omarchy, bringing a fresh approach to the same foundation. Its structure, themes, and menus go beyond what comes by default with Omakub or Ubuntu, making it easier to contribute, maintain, and improve the overall ecosystem. It also simplifies the creation of themes and customizations, which were previously more difficult to achieve in Omakub.

I understand the enthusiasm around Arch and Hyprland, and the desire to build a system from the ground up to match that aesthetic and philosophy. However, there are still many who prefer a stable and predictable base — for practical, professional, or personal reasons — and who continue to believe in what Omakub represents. Omakube was created precisely for them: to carry that vision forward and make it even better.

So...

## In the heart is Omakub...

It's called Omakube, but that's only a superficial name. Deep down, _it's still the same, beloved Omakub_. The folders, variables, and scripts bear his name, and that's the way it will always be. It's not meant to be anything else...and this is also to ensure it's always compatible with the project it's based on.

## ...but with the passion of Omarchy

The drive and desire to provide something interesting and enjoyable comes from _Omarchy_, which constantly observes and borrows ideas. Whenever a valuable feature appears, if it can be implemented without compromising stability, chances are it will be found here as well.
