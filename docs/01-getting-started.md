# Welcome to Omakube!

<div class="space-y-4">

**Omakube** is an opinionated Ubuntu configuration crafted for developers who value productivity and aesthetics, built with modern tools, sensible defaults, and zero bloat.

The project doesn’t just provide a ready-made configuration for newcomers to Linux; it also aims to create a comfortable and thoughtful environment, so you don’t need to struggle with setup. _Everything’s already in place—just open the terminal and start exploring_.
