# Extra Hotkeys

You can extend your setup with extra hotkeys whenever you need. Omabuntu includes helper commands like `omakub-keybinding-add` and `omakub-keybinding-remove`, which let you register a new shortcut or drop one you no longer want. For example, you can add a custom binding with `omakub-keybinding-add ctrl+alt+h your-command` or remove it later with `omakub-keybinding-remove ctrl+alt+h`.

There is no need to edit configuration files by hand because these commands take care of the setup for you, keeping your environment easy to update and adjust.
