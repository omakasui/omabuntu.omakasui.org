# Backgrounds

All Omabuntu backgrounds are stored in `~/.config/omakub/backgrounds/[theme]`.
If you want to add a new image to a specific theme, for example _nord_, just place the file inside `~/.config/omakub/backgrounds/nord`.

The easiest way to access the correct folder is through the _Omabuntu Menu_:
go to _Install > Style > Background_. This opens the directory associated with the currently active theme.

From there, open a second file manager window with `Super + Shift + F`, locate your image, and copy it into the theme folder. Once added, it automatically becomes part of the rotation cycle. You can switch between available backgrounds using `Super + Ctrl + Space`.

If you're looking for high-quality wallpapers, a large curated collection is available in the [dharmx/walls repository](https://github.com/dharmx/walls) on GitHub.
